# Region Wise Cost Analysis and Visualization of IT Departments using Microsoft PowerBI
A cost analysis dataset of region-wise different IT departments was used for this project. I used ms excel and powerBI query tools to analyze and build the relational model. 
After that, I used different visualization tools to show different budgets and forecasts comparisons. I also compared between *actual, budget and forecasts* data.

For this project, I used the following datasets:
1. Budget.csv
2. dim_tables.xlsx
3. Forecast.csv

Later in the PowerBI, I used the above data to build some additional table datasets for better analysis and visualizing. The tables are:
1. Actuals
2. CostElements
3. Departments
4. Region
